# Calendar

How to Run
To run Calendar just download the jar and double click it. Understand that the Calendar application will create a directory to store calendar information in C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Local\Calendar. The Calendar directory file will not be made if already there.

How to Use
- do not tamper with the default files made in C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Local\Calendar unless you do not want the Calendar app to properly function anymore.
- closing the app: press the "Esc" key on any piece of the application that is not a text box
- moving around the app: click, hold, and move your mouse around on any piece of the application that is not a text box.
- minimizing the app: press the "-" key
- reset the current month's calendar: press the "r" key then click the green button to reset. The red button closes the option panel and waiting about 8 seconds automatically closes the options panel.
- saving calendar: although the calendar app automatically saves when closing the app, changing months, changing years, and changing directories you can still press the "s" key to manually save your calendar.
- switching between months: press the "Right_Arrow" or "Up_Arrow" key to move forward a month (and year if you go from December to January). press the "Left_Arrow" or "Down_Arrow" key to move backwards a month (and year if you go from January to December).
- changing directories: press on the text box with a file path and enter in your new desired file path then press enter. Keep in mind that after about 10 seconds the file path will automatically revert back to the current Calendar's path (I would recommend copy pasting the file path instead of typing it). Also keep in mind that entering a new file path with no Calendar yet made will automatically begin creating files at that path. Finally, typing in an invalid path for a directory will cause new Calendar to be unsavable until the path is fixed/corrected.
